Hey! Thanks for checking out my website.

I am currently a research scientist with the University of Toronto's Acceleration Consortium, working to accelerate materials discovery by combining machine learning with laboratory automation to create [self driving labs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-022-00231-0). At present my focus is on formulations science, where I develop automation and machine learning models for a diversity of materials, everything from pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to concrete.
